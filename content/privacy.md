I have a hybrid cloud setup where services and data that require high availability live in the cloud and more sensitive data lives on my own hardware (onsite).

Pterodactyl panel - data is stored in the cloud (includes: email address, encrypted password, server data like name, description and your ip address in activity logs). your server files and backups are both stored onsite.

Revolt (alecks chat) - messages, account data, servers, logs and all other data is stored on an onsite server (service is not recommended for highly sensitive conversations)

~~Encrypted disk backups of all servers are uploaded to backblaze b2~~ (work in progress)

Send data erasure requests to alecks03@proton.me, include all data possible and proof its yours.
