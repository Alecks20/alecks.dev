I've always hated the cloud, expensive subscriptions, random terminations, no physical control over your data, the trust factor and more. Which is why I plan to have zero cloud server subscriptions by 2026 and run everything from here.

Currently everything is brand new hardware but I'd like to get into repurposing some second-hand builds later on.

*More servers coming soon...*
