## Projects
What I'm currently working on, really not a lot right now (* = priority).
### In Development
[*Thoughty](https://thoughty.xyz) - your own free, private and anonymous internet diary and thought organiser with cloud sync, efficient tools and a public feed.

[Packs](https://packs.alecks.dev) - free and easy resource pack hosting for minecraft servers, with a dashboard coming (eventually).

### Not maintined / On Hold
[URL Shortener](https://github.com/Alecks20/URL-Shortener) - standalone url shortening service that depends on mongo (built to be integrated with my other services)

[CDN](https://github.com/Alecks20/cdn) - really barebones express web server that delivers files from a folder.

### Discontinued
[a3d.pro](https://github.com/Alecks20/Personal-Website) - my old website built with flask, html and css.

[Cloudy](https://github.com/alecks20/Cloudy) - multipurpose discord bot with fun, games, moderation, utilites and more.

[Panda-py](https://github.com/Alecks20/Panda-py) - my first attempt at building a discord bot with discord.py, also my first python project.

[Mongo Migrator](https://github.com/Alecks20/Mongo-Migrator) - originally made for when I migrated my discord bot to new servers, transfers every db, collection and object on a mongo server to a new one.

[Alecks Media](https://github.com/Alecks20/Alecks-Media/) - flask website that let you upload and fetch files on it (via gui and api)
