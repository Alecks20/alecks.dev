Hello internet, 

My name is Alex and I'm a self-taught developer from Australia who has a passion for system administration and programming (Currently know Python and JS) I like anime, gaming, linux, tinking with computers, homelabs, and much more.

I use this website to publish blog posts and showcase what I'm up to, currently its just guides, rants and my experiences.


If you wish to contact me you can send an email (alecks03@pm.me), or add me on discord (alecks20), both will have around the same response time (~1-2 days).
