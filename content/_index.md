Hello internet, 

My name is Alecks and I'm a self-taught developer from Australia who has a strong passion for system administration and programming (Currently know Python and JS) I like shows, anime, games and linux (Running Nobara).

This website is for showcasing my stuff, expressing my personality, writing pointless things, etc. If you wish to see stuff like that feel free to take a look around.


Find me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/612522818294251522), [GitHub](https://github.com/Alecks20) and [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/hikariasahi/).
