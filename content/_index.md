Hello Internet, 

My name is Alecks, I'm a self-taught developer from Australia with a passion for system administration, networking, infrastructure, homelabbing and programming (Fairly experienced in Python, new to JavaScript). I also enjoy anime, reading and movies.

I use this website to publish my writings (blog posts, rants, guides) and run my own little digital garden on the internet.

Find me on the web - [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199121598457/), [GitHub](https://github.com/Alecks20)
