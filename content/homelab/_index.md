# My Homelab

----


The cloud is expensive, you can have random terminations or account issues, theres no physical control over your data and much more. I plan to have zero cloud server subscriptions by 2026 and run everything from here.

Currently everything is brand new hardware but I'd like to get into repurposing some second hand builds later on.
