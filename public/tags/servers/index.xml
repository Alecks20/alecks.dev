<h2 id="non-root-account-for-logins">Non-root account for logins</h2>
<p>When securing ssh on your server the first thing you want to to do is change the user you login as, start with making a new user with any username you want</p>





<pre tabindex="0"><code>adduser declan</code></pre><p>After that add it to the list of sudoers</p>





<pre tabindex="0"><code>usermod -aG sudo declan</code></pre><h2 id="moving-to-ssh-keys">Moving to SSH keys</h2>
<p>I think it should be pretty obvious that using plaintext passwords for logging into your system isn&rsquo;t the best idea, so thats why you should use something like PuTTYGen to generate an ssh key, generate a new key then copy and paste the public key generated into <code>/home/declan/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> (Change to your username)</p>
<p>Each key is seperated by a new line, simply paste the key in with no spaces or anything else around</p>
<h2 id="changing-the-ssh-configuration">Changing the SSH configuration</h2>
<p>This process can differ depending on your host, but for most servers the ssh config is located in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d</code>, in this file you want to change the following values</p>





<pre tabindex="0"><code>PubkeyAuthentication yes</code></pre>




<pre tabindex="0"><code>PasswordAuthentication no</code></pre>




<pre tabindex="0"><code>PermitRootLogin no</code></pre>




<pre tabindex="0"><code>Port 13923</code></pre><p>This will disable password authentication, disable root login (Make sure you&rsquo;ve setup another account) and allow you to login using ssh keys, which I showed how to setup above and change the ssh port</p>
<p>Run the command below to apply the ssh configuration settings</p>





<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo systemctl restart ssh</code></pre><h2 id="configuring-a-firewall">Configuring a firewall</h2>
<p>You can use UFW which is preinstalled on ubuntu and can be installed on debian using apt, it can be easily setup using a few commands, a firewall blocks connections to ports or services you don&rsquo;t want exposed</p>
<h3 id="allowingdenying-a-port">Allowing/Denying a port</h3>





<pre tabindex="0"><code>ufw allow [port]</code></pre>




<pre tabindex="0"><code>ufw deny [port]</code></pre><h3 id="allowing-a-range-of-ports">Allowing a range of ports</h3>





<pre tabindex="0"><code>ufw allow [port]:[port]/tcp</code></pre>




<pre tabindex="0"><code>ufw allow [port]:[port]/udp</code></pre><h3 id="enabling-the-firewall">Enabling the firewall</h3>





<pre tabindex="0"><code>ufw enable</code></pre><h3 id="checking-firewall-status">Checking firewall status</h3>





<pre tabindex="0"><code>ufw status</code></pre><h2 id="ntfy-notifcations-on-login">NTFY notifcations on login</h2>
<p>As an extra security precaution you can use ntfy to get mobile notifications whenever someone remotely connects to your server, I used <a href="https://paramdeo.com/blog/enabling-ssh-login-notifications-using-ntfy">this</a> tutorial and it worked for me, you can also find an example on the ntfy docs <a href="https://docs.ntfy.sh/examples/#ssh-login-alerts">here</a></p>

      <title>Oracle cloud is a horrible platform.</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/oracle-cloud-rant/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For quite a while I used to use oracle cloud to host pretty much all of my stuff, from minecraft servers, to self hosted storage solutions and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I signed up for the platform on April 20th 2023, and ended up leaving/being terminated from the platform for literally no reason at all on the 29th of November, I ran 2 oracle cloud accounts and only 1 of them was terminated so I continued using the platform until late 2023 (around December) when I left the platform for good&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For quite a while I used to use oracle cloud to host pretty much all of my stuff, from minecraft servers, to self hosted storage solutions and much more.</p>
<p>I signed up for the platform on April 20th 2023, and ended up leaving/being terminated from the platform for literally no reason at all on the 29th of November, I ran 2 oracle cloud accounts and only 1 of them was terminated so I continued using the platform until late 2023 (around December) when I left the platform for good</p>
<h2 id="random-termination">Random Termination</h2>
<p>When my account was terminated, I received ZERO communication from oracle about it, the only way I found out about it is my uptime monitor notified me about my server going offline and me trying to figure out the cause. While doing this I found that my dashboard was broken. Every page on it said “Permission denied” or something along those lines. Nothing said my account was terminated until I googled the cause and found a reddit post talking about having the exact same thing happening to them.</p>
<p>The weird thing about this is the fact that I didn’t do anything wrong and even if I did I should have at least been notified about it, thankfully I wasn’t storing anything important on it but if I was then a ton of my stuff would have been completely wiped.</p>
<p>To make the situation even worse, I couldn’t even contact support about the issue because you needed an “Active Tenancy” to use the support service but since my account was terminated/disabled I couldn’t access it, I couldn’t even use the live chat on the dashboard because you needed a premium plan to talk to a real person on it.</p>
<p>There are a few things I thought off that could’ve got my account terminated in the first place, but its impossible to know because they didn’t give me any information about it</p>
<ul>
<li>Since I ran a minecraft server off it, there would constantly be people spamming the ports of my server from server scanners. This also connects to the fact that a lot of people who have had this happen to them before also ran minecraft servers off their oracle cloud servers.</li>
<li>When trying to upgrade my server to a PAYG account (Which is like oracle’s “paid” service, if you don’t upgrade then you can’t go over the free tier limits) oracle randomly said my card was invalid and removed it from my account, even though the card was perfectly fine and it was also the same one I used at signup.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closing-my-account">“Closing” my account</h2>
<p>Another issue I have with oracles cloud service is that when you “delete” a tenancy (An account) it doesn’t actually delete ANYTHING, it just disables it putting it under the illusion that its gone. You can even still login to the account and access the dashboard. I disabled my other oracle cloud account expecting to be able to sign up for it again once the old one was deleted and change the home region, however im still waiting to this day 4 months later for it to fully delete and it hasn’t yet and im not expecting it to at all.</p>
<p>So that is why I will not ever be returning to this horrible cloud provider, their offering is great, but its free for a reason. Overall its not a bad offering, just make sure to</p>
